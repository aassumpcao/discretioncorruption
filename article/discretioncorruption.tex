\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

An important discussion in developing countries is whether governments attract qualified professionals to implement policy and efficiently allocate scarce resources. When public officials are competent, there does not seem to exist much opposition to these policymakers having discretion in the allocation of public resources. This is particularly important when it comes to lower-level bureaucrats, who know more about the communities they serve and, thus, are better placed to understand and deliver on the needs of their people \citep{LipskyStreetLevelBureaucracy30th2010}. However, it is often the case that governments attract a heterogeneous pool of workers with high and low quality professionals. Some might even be good professionals but have bad intentions. Incompetence and rent-seeking behavior help explain why officials deviate from their duties and why spending controls are called into action \citep{LambsdorffCorruptionRentSeeking2002, OlkenCorruptionCostsRedistribution2006}.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between discretion in public spending and government performance. In particular, we look at whether lower discretion reduces corruption and misallocation of public resources in Brazilian municipalities. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the economics literature specifically focusing on the effect of discretion on government performance. There are many studies looking at the relationship between economic or political decentralization and corruption \citep{Treismancausescorruptioncrossnational2000,FismanDecentralizationcorruptionevidence2002,FanPoliticaldecentralizationcorruption2009,ChoudhuryGovernmentaldecentralizationcorruption2015}, but they generally face similar issues: they present cross-country evidence, unable to capture \emph{within}-country corruption heterogeneity \citep{Treismancausescorruptioncrossnational2000,FismanDecentralizationcorruptionevidence2002}; they employ perception-based \citep{Treismancausescorruptioncrossnational2000,FismanDecentralizationcorruptionevidence2002} and experienced-based \citep{FanPoliticaldecentralizationcorruption2009,ChoudhuryGovernmentaldecentralizationcorruption2015} corruption measures,  both susceptible to non-trivial measurement error; and, finally, they are all dealing with some sort of imperfect measurement of economic and political decentralization (devolution of fiscal revenues and number of government levels, for instance). Moreover, decentralization encompasses many context-specific factors beyond discretion that could jointly determine government performance.

% We exploit discontinuities in Brazilian  procurement law to assess whether tighter spending rules make it more difficult for public officials to extract rents (\citealt{becker1968,rose1975,stigler1970}) and to misallocate resources. Exogenous variation comes from Law 8,666, passed in 1993, which determines procurement types for all government levels in Brazil as a function of the amount procured. By looking at municipal purchase orders around monetary cutoffs where procurement rules changes discontinuously, we infer causal relationships between discretion and corruption.

% The change to stricter procurement rules increases corruption by 12.5 percentage points. The legislation does a poor job of deterring corruption, most likely because procurement types are not much different from each other. The policy takeaway is the need to improve the design of spending regulations.

% Besides looking at an unexplored determinant of corruption, we also contribute to the literature by employing an objective measure of corruption in line with \cite{bertrand2007obtaining,olken2009corruption,fismanmiguel} and a few others. Our measure is similar to that of \cite{ferraz01052008,ferraz2011} but we use improvements made by \cite{lopes2011} to build our corruption index. Finally, we contribute to advance the use of regression discontinuity by suggesting an interpretation of fuzzy RD when the researcher cannot precisely observe the assignment variable.

% The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section II introduces our theoretical model, section III presents previous studies and our data. We run empirical tests in section IV and discuss results in V. Section VI concludes.

\section{Background and Data} \label{sec:background}

\subsection{Data} \label{subsec:data}

\section{Estimation Strategy} \label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Model} \label{subsec:model}

The simple model here is based on \citet{OlkenCorruptionDevelopingCountries2012b} and posits a straightforward relationship between discretion and corruption. A representative policymaker earns wage \emph{w} from working in government and an additional bribe \emph{b} if she decides to engage in corruption. Her market wage is \emph{v}, which she receives if she quits, or is fired, from her government position. If she chooses corruption, she must pay her individual dishonesty cost \emph{d} and subject herself to the probability of detection \emph{p}. For simplicity, we treat each corruption decision as an independent, one-time decision. Thus, officials will engage in corruption when:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:simplemodel}
  \begin{split}
    w - v < \frac{1-p}{p}\times(b-d)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The first important change we make to the model above is the treatment of corruption gains \emph{b} as a function of procurement amount \emph{x}. In our context, every procurement call is a one-off opportunity for corruption where officials can earn \emph{b} and leave the market upon collecting their bribe. In this case, corruption bears little resemblance to the frequent, fixed payments in exchange for continuous favors as described in \citet{OlkenCorruptionDevelopingCountries2012b}, where corruption gains are fixed. As contract value goes up, we can expect that officials will ask for (or will be offered) larger payments to favor one bidder or another. This relationship can also be described as the opportunity cost of corruption, and posits that bribe levels are increasing in the value of goods/services being procured -- a \$100,000 contract might see a \$5,000 bribe while a \$50,000 contract might see a \$3,000 bribe.\footnote{We additionally assume that officials are risk-averse since the larger the contract the larger the public attention for any given procurement call.}


Secondly, Brazilian procurement rules \emph{l} impose an additional cost of corruption beyond \emph{p} and \emph{d}. As contract amount increases, officials are subject to stricter procurement requirements regarding the number of participants in the procurement process, the documents they have to submit, how long the call for participants should be open, and other issues as described in section \ref{subsec:data}. Procurement categories determine the rules each official has to follow and, as a consequence, the opportunity cost for corruption. For instance, stricter rules offset the lower opportunity cost of corruption; we discuss their relationship in section \ref{subsec:hypotheses}.

The last novel contribution here is modeling individual corruption decision as endogenous. In this setting, officials behave strategically: if they see their colleagues engaging in corrupt exchanges and getting by unnoticed, they are also more likely to be corrupt themselves simply because their cost of being honest is higher. Holding constant the ability to uncover and prosecute corruption cases (due to local resource constraints), the probability of detection of any wrongdoing decreases with the number of dishonest people and the number of illegal actions in each municipality. In other words, being honest in a corrupt environment is costly. \citet{FerrazExposingCorruptPoliticians2008b}, \citet{WintersLackingInformationCondoning2013}, and \citet{ChongDoesCorruptionInformation2015} document a similar behavior according to which voters discount corruption evidence from electoral punishment when corruption is endemic in local elections in Brazil and Mexico. There is no reason to think that local government officials would behave differently. After including these factors to equation \ref{eq:simplemodel}, the corruption function then becomes:\footnote{There is no particular functional form determining the relationship among all variables in our framework. We mostly focus on the most important factors summarizing the relationship between discretion and corruption.}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bribefunction}
  \begin{aligned}
    b = f(w,\ v,\ p,\ d,\ x,\ l,\ r)& \\
    \nabla f'(-,+,-,-,+,-,+)&
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Where \emph{b} is a corruption measure as a function of all previous variables (\emph{w, v, p, d}) plus procurement amount \emph{x}, procurement rules \emph{l}, and municipal level of corruption \emph{r}. The representative official wants to maximize \emph{b} with respect to all right-hand side variables and their hypothesized relationship is summarized by \emph{f}'s first derivative signs in line 2 of equation \ref{eq:simplemodel}. The efficiency wage hypothesis predicts that higher public sector wages \emph{w} would reduce corruption by increasing the returns to honesty and making illegal options less attractive. The same rationale applies to market wages \emph{v}, wherein an increase in earnings would have to be met by higher returns to public office either in wages (relatively rigid) or bribes (relatively flexible) to clear public and private labor markets. Finally, the corruption literature suggests that both the probability of detection \emph{p} and dishonesty costs \emph{d} (which is an unobservable individual cost function including the severity of punishment) are important factors for corruption deterrence \citep{BeckerCrimePunishmentEconomic1968,Rose-AckermanEconomicsCorruption1975}.\footnote{Article 37 of the Brazilian Constitution, Law 8,666/93, and the related legislation lay out the punishment for individual corruption in the public sector. Severity, however, does not change over the period under analysis (2004-2010) and, as such, is irrelevant for the model developed here; i.e.~the constant term in the regression equations in section \ref{subsec:design} soaks up any severity effects.}

The last three variables in equation \ref{eq:bribefunction} are the centerpiece of our model. We anticipate that  procurement amount \emph{x} and overall municipal corruption \emph{r} are positively correlated with one's decision to engage in corruption and jointly offset the efforts to reduce corruption by imposing stricter, less discretionary rules on public spending in Brazil. Moreover, \emph{x} and \emph{r} have negative second derivatives, representing the official's risk-aversion, while \emph{l} should have a positive second derivative. In other words, higher-order procurement types are less effective at reducing corruption than lower-order types. These relationships are described below.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:derivatives}
  (i)   f_{x} > 0; f_{xx} < 0 \qquad \qquad
  (ii)  f_{l} < 0; f_{ll} > 0 \qquad \qquad
  (iii) f_{r} > 0; f_{rr} < 0 \qquad \qquad
\end{equation}

The analysis in this paper focuses on the partial derivatives in (ii), and we are interested in potential endogenous relationships between \emph{l}, \emph{x}, and \emph{r}. According to Law 8,666/93, contracting rules are a deterministic function of procurement amount, so we know with certainty that \emph{l} is a function of \emph{x}. On the other hand, the procurement categories in the Brazilian legislation are independent of any particular government corruption, so we know that \emph{l} does not depend on \emph{r}. The only effect of the existing corruption level on procurement type works through the contracting amount (in other words, $l'(r) = 0$). The direction of this effect, however, is unclear: although a more corrupt body of public officials might want larger contracting values so that their cut compensates the risk of detection, we cannot rule out a negative effect on procurement amount if corrupt, but smart, officials would know best and keep their corruption earnings low enough not to draw any attention to their actions. In the section \ref{subsec:design}, we discuss the identification strategy that allows us to isolate the causal effects of discretion on corruption.

\subsubsection{Side effect on Mismanagement of Public Resources} \label{subsubsec:mismanagement}

In addition to reducing corruption, the Brazilian procurement legislation should lead to a more efficient allocation of public resources. The first reason is that fewer resources would be lost to corruption and, thus, they would be correctly employed to deliver both more and better policy. However, since performance indicators are aggregated at the municipal level, we cannot really isolate the effect of individual procurement rules on policy from other performance determinants, i.e. the quality of the bureaucracy, physical infrastructure, legal institutions, etc.

The second channel through which procurement rules could reduce the misallocation of resources is by standardizing the procurement of goods and services and by making local government officials stick to policy plans set out at higher levels of government. In the case of Brazilian municipalities, this effectively means adhering to federal-mandated school and health programs instead of using funds to cover other competing expenses or budget shortfalls. Thus, we also look at the effect of discretion on mismanagement of public resources.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:alternativeoutcome}
  \begin{aligned}
    m = f(w,\ v,\ p,\ d,\ x,\ l,\ r)& \\
    \nabla f'(-,+,-,-,+,-,+)&
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  m_{l} < 0

\section{Appendix: Service Order Classification} \label{sec:appendixA}

Service orders issued by CGU investigated different uses of public resources in addition to procurement, e.g.~for officials compensation, for school activities, or for community monitoring of public policies. The discretion measure proposed here, however, is exclusive to procurement expenditures made under Law 8,666/93. The ideal dataset for this study would contain explicit procurement information collected by CGU auditors, but unfortunately this is not the case. The reporting of procurement processes is implicit, via descriptions of investigations or findings of violations to Law 8,666/93. Thus, we isolate service orders which investigated procurement processes from the rest by implementing an classification system based on the information retrieval and natural-language processing literatures.

The system uses each service order's description to identify if it is procurement-related. In these descriptions, CGU auditors report the purpose of their investigation, e.g.~whether they are looking into painkiller purchases, whether the municipality has used the funds within designated goals, or whether primary school teachers were hired for the implementation of a school program. Using these textual descriptions as bag-of-words models, we implement a method similar to that of \citet{HopkinsMethodAutomatedNonparametric2009}: we stem and combine unigrams to form search patterns that identify a service order as procurement-related. There are two broad types of procurement in Law 8,666/93: (i) ordinary procurement of goods and services, which we call \emph{purchases}; and (ii) procurement of goods and services used for public works, which we call \emph{works}. There are different search patterns for each type.

An example is useful for understanding our classification process. Unigram ``aquisição'' (\emph{acquisition} in English) is stemmed to ``aquisi'' to form a search pattern for the \emph{purchases}-type procurement; unigrams ``adequação'' and ``habitacional'' are stemmed and combined to form ``adequa(.)*habitac''\footnote{All seach patterns are regular expressions.} search pattern for \emph{works}-type procurement. This bigram picks up variations in main keywords as well as coding mistakes due to, for instance, multiple whitespace between the two unigrams or due to coding Portuguese special characters (``adequação'' vs. ``adequacao'').

\begin{table}[!htbp]

  \hline

  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The final list contains 19 \emph{n}-grams for identification of purchases and 17 \emph{n}-grams for works.\footnote{One of these keywords in the works search pattern is an ``exclusion keyword,'' which removes service orders that contain the ``exclusion keyword'' in their description from the sample identified by the other 16 \emph{n}-grams.} When any of these words is found, we include the service order into the purchases or the works group. Since all public works projects procure goods and services but not all public purchases are works-related, whenever the search patterns matches service orders to both groups, we include the service order only in the works group but not in the purchases group. Public works procurements are a subset of all public procurements in Brazilian municipalities. The search patterns here identify a total of 9,593 procurement-related service orders.

}
\end{figure}

As \citet{GrimmerTextDataPromise2013a} rightly point out, no text analysis algorithm is perfect and only relying on keyword matches could potentially lead to misclassification of service orders. Let us suppose that one description reads ``expenditures made in accordance with primary education program.'' Using unigram ``expenditure'' would yield a match for this service order to the purchases group, but in fact auditors might be looking at bonus payments for high-performing teachers. These resources could also be directed for school construction. In the first case, the service order should not be have been included in any group because it does not carry any procurement component. In the second case, it should have also been marked as public works.

We address these classification problems in three ways: (i) using means comparison tests of match quality discussed in \citet{AssumpcaotextfindDataDrivenText2018}; (ii) comparing the performance of the same search patterns on another textual description for a subset of service orders; (iii) finally, comparing the results from the textual classification algorithm to that of procurement violations reported by CGU auditors. We discuss these three tests in turns in the following sections.

\subsection{Means Tests}\label{subsec:quality1}

The first test on match quality is the means comparison test presented in \citet{AssumpcaotextfindDataDrivenText2018}, whose reasoning is simple. Increasing the number of procurement-related terms in the search pattern is not necessarily good practice as we increase the chance of misclassifying service orders as procurement when in fact they are not; words can take on different meanings depending on their contexts, so the more search terms we use the more likely type I error is. Ideally, we would want to use as few \emph{n}-grams as possible while still identifying all possible procurement matches. In order to do this, what \citet{AssumpcaotextfindDataDrivenText2018} suggests is testing match quality by incrementally comparing sample means identified by \emph{n} vs. \emph{n} - 1 keywords. This method translates into a check on whether the sample identified by one additional keyword is significantly better than the previous sample with one fewer term. The program developed by \citet{AssumpcaotextfindDataDrivenText2018} does this for us and we report the results in the tables below:

\input{appendix_tab2}

The search terms are sorted in descending order by the number of service orders they identify (column 1). Column 6 displays \emph{p}-values for means tests across samples, where each mean is the sum of observations found by \emph{any} of the search items before, and inclusive of, any particular row over the total number of observations.\footnote{This is also known as an alternative search where all search conditions are connected by an ``or'' statement.} The means test thus compares whether the sample identified by all search terms up to any row is significantly different from the the sample identified by all rows before. For instance, the evidence presented in row four of table \ref{tab:purchasesresults} is that the inclusion of search item ``ve{[}íi{]}culo'' significantly improves (at the 5\% level) the identification of the purchases sample when compared to the sample which only includes the previous three search words.

\input{appendix_tab3}

The works sample is a third of the size of the purchases group and two of its search items do not significantly identify a new sample (``saneamento'' and ``conclus{[}ãa{]}o''). Despite having positive individual finds reported in column 1, table \ref{tab:worksresults}, the means test in column 6 suggests that these finds are not new service orders in addition to what had already been identified by the the previous search terms.\footnote{The search without these terms (available upon request) yields 2,679 service orders, just three short of the total in table \ref{tab:worksresults}. Nevertheless, we keep the two items in the search algorithm for additional tests discussed in section \ref{subsec:quality2}.}

Means tests are important to map out the relationship between search items, both within and across groups, but they do not tell us anything about the relationship between search items and their latent procurement groups. In other words, the search terms might be picking up groups that are internally consistent but that do not map onto the procurement types in Law 8,666/93. We discuss these issues in sections \ref{subsec:quality2} and \ref{subsec:quality3}.

\subsection{Textual Descriptions}\label{subsec:quality2}

CGU service orders can best be described as investigations on the use of
public resources transferred from the federal government to Brazilian
municipalities. There are six transfer types and each service order
investigates only one type at a time. Since the procurement categories
set out in Law 8,666/93 apply to all public procurements at all
government levels, transfer types are irrelevant for constructing our
discretion measure. Nonetheless, one type of these transfers helps test
our classification algorithm.

Federal grants (\emph{convênios} in Portuguese) are narrow transfer
agreements signed by the federal government, its agencies, states and
municipalities for the delivery of governmental programs. They are
voluntary, time-limited transfers implementing policies at the local
level, such as vaccinations and the construction of community health
clinics. The most important feature of these grants, however, is that
each of them also has an individual textual description of its purpose,
e.g.~a tractor purchase for a rural community in a given municipality.
Thus, for a subset of service orders that are investigations of the use
of these federal grants by Brazilian municipalities, we have two
different textual descriptions of resource use: CGU's, from their audit
report, and the federal government's, available online at the
Transparency Portal.\footnote{\url{http://www.portaltransparencia.gov.br/}}

\input{appendix_tab4}

There is a total of 3,868 service orders for which we have descriptions both from CGU and from the federal government. In table \ref{tab:textualdescription}, we report the results of the search algorithm both in the service order (row-wise) and the transfer (column-wise) descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the search algorithm by checking whether it assigns the same service order to the same procurement group \emph{regardless of the description in which it searches for the key terms}. In other words, the smaller the number of times that the algorithm assigns any service order to a different group when it switches to another textual description, the better.

This is a particularly important point for the classification method proposed here. The means test conducted in section \ref{subsec:quality1} provides internal consistency because it compares and checks whether more observations are matched when more search terms are included; the tabulation across descriptions here provides external consistency because it compares and checks if the classification algorithm is independent of search target (description). It resembles a false positive (type I error) test because we can roughly calculate the percentage of misclassification of service orders. In panel A, the service order description search assigns 1,556 to the purchases group, out of which 83 were not simultaneously assigned to the same group in the grant description search, yielding a 5.3\% false positive rate. In panel B, the service order search marks 2,053 observations to the works group, where 404 are not simultaneously marked when the search is performed in the grant description (a 19.7\% type I error rate).\footnote{The inverse misclassification rates are also reassuring: false positives are 8.9\% and 14.0\% for purchases and works respectively when we first classify observations using grant descriptions and then move on to service order descriptions.}

\subsection{Procurement Violations}\label{subsec:quality3}

Though section \ref{subsec:quality2} supports external validity by showing that the service order classification is consistent across textual descriptions, we run the last robustness check here using the actual procurement violations reported by CGU.

The findings reported by auditors are coded into 35 infractions of the use of public resources, nine of which violations of procurement rules and one violation of public works rules. Thus, we know with certainty that service orders for which there are any of the nine procurement violations (ten if public works) are in fact procurement-related and should be classified either as purchases, works, or both. As opposed to section \ref{subsec:quality2}, this resembles a false negative (type II error) test on yet another subset of observations for which certain infractions were reported.\footnote{The reason why this is a type II error test, instead of type I, resides on the way the test samples are defined. In section \ref{subsec:quality2}, both sample assignments (by matching procurement keywords in the service order or grant description) can be the ``correct'' procurement sample against which the match on the alternative description might yield false positives. In this section, we know with certainty that the sample identified by procurement infractions is in fact the correctly identified sample, since there cannot exist a procurement violation where no procurement has occurred. It makes the unidentified observations false negatives because they should have been classified as procurement-related service orders. This sample is clearly underidentified, as there are many procurement-related service orders that simply followed Law 8,666/93 and thus carry no infraction, but still, within this subset of all CGU investigations, it provides us with a good conterfactual against which to test our classification mechanism.}

\input{appendix_tab5}

The total number of service orders with at least one procurement infraction is 3,775 (4,146 if we include the public works infraction), which is the sum of column 2 in table \ref{tab:textbycode}, panels A and B. The false negative rate is 8.5\% and 9.9\%, respectively, for purchases-only and works procurements. This means that 319 and 344 service orders should have been classified as procurement by our textual search algorithm but were not.

Although no text analysis mechanism is perfect, the evidence presented here supports our choice of classification algorithm. The identification of procurement orders is internally consistent (section \ref{subsec:quality1}), there are very few incorrect assignments of service orders to procurement (section \ref{subsec:quality2}), and the sample which was identified as procurement maps well onto the latent categories in the Brazilian procurement legislation (section \ref{subsec:quality3}).

\section{Service Amount Maniputation}\label{sec:appendixC}

The identification strategy in this paper relies on the assumption that municipal officials do not (completely) manipulate public expenditure amounts in order to avoid stricter procurement rules. In other words, the public procurement processes carried out just below and above any discretion threshold, which is uniquely determined by procurement amount, are equal except for the rules set out in Law 8,666/93 -- thus they are good counterfactuals for testing the effect of expenditure discretion on corruption. We present below the \citet{McCraryManipulationrunningvariable2008} test for manipulation of running variable for all six cutoffs in the Brazilian procurement legislation.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \includegraphics[scale=.41]{purchasesmanipulation3} & \includegraphics[scale=.41]{worksmanipulation3} \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

The graphs in figure \ref{fig:manipulationtests} show there is no significant difference between service order density just below and above discretion cutoffs imposed by Law 8,666/93. As discussed in section \ref{sec:methodology}, however, we drop works cutoff three from the analysis due to the small number of observations and analyze purchases cutoff three and works cutoff one with caution.
