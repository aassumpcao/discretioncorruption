\section{Appendix: Service Order Classification}\label{appendixA}}

Service orders issued by CGU investigated different uses of public
resources in addition to procurement, e.g.~for officials compensation,
for school activities, or for community monitoring of public policies.
The discretion measure proposed here, however, is exclusive to
procurement expenditures made under Law 8,666/93, thus we need to
isolate service orders which investigated procurement processes from the
rest. Since there is no such direct reporting in CGU reports, we
implement a service order classification system based on the information
retrieval and natural-language processing literatures.

We use each service order's description to identify if it is
procurement-related. In these descriptions, CGU auditors report the
purpose of their investigation, e.g.~whether they are looking into
painkiller purchases, whether the municipality has used the funds within
designated goals, or whether primary school teachers were hired for the
implementation of a school program. Using these textual descriptions as
bag-of-words models, we implement a method similar to that of Hopkins \&
King (2009): we stem and combine unigrams to form search patterns that
identify a service order as procurement-related. There are two broad
types of procurement in Law 8,666/93: (i) ordinary procurement of goods
and services, which we call \emph{purchases}; and (ii) procurement of
goods and services used for public works, which we call \emph{works}.
There are different search patterns for each type.

An example is useful for understanding our classification process.
Unigram ``aquisição'' (\emph{acquisition} in English) is stemmed to
``aquisi'' to form a search pattern for the \emph{purchases}-type
procurement; unigrams ``adequação'' and ``habitacional'' are stemmed and
combined to form ``adequa(.)*habitac''\footnote{All seach patterns are
  regular expressions.} search pattern for \emph{works}-type
procurement. The bigram picks up variations in main keywords as well as
coding mistakes due to, for instance, multiple whitespace between the
two unigrams or due to coding Portuguese special characters
(``adequação'' vs ``adequacao'').

\textbf{Table A.1: Procurement Search Terms}

\emph{- insert figure 1: keywords here -}

The final list contains 19 \emph{n}-grams for identification of
purchases and 17 \emph{n}-grams for works.\footnote{One of these
  keywords in the works search pattern is an ``exclusion keyword,''
  which removes service orders that contain the ``exclusion keyword'' in
  their description from the sample found by the other 17
  \emph{n}-grams.} When any of these words is found, we include the
service order into the purchases or the works group. Since all public
works projects procure goods and services but not all public purchases
are works-related, whenever the search patterns matches service orders
to both groups, we include the service order only in the works group but
not in the purchases group. Public works procurements are a subset of
all public procurements in Brazilian municipalities. The search patterns
here identify a total of 9,593 procurement-related service orders.

\textbf{Figure A.1: Service Order Mapping}

\emph{- insert figure 1: Venn Diagram here -}

As Grimmer \& Stewart (2013) rightly point out, no text analysis
algorithm is perfect and only relying on keyword matches could
potentially lead to misclassification of service orders. Let us suppose
that one description reads ``expenditures made in accordance with
primary education program.'' Using unigram ``expenditure'' would yield a
match for this service order to the purchases group, but in fact
auditors might be looking at bonus payments for high-performing
teachers. These resources could also be directed for school
construction. In the first case, the service order should not be have
been included in any group because it does not carry any procurement
component. In the second case, it should have also been marked as public
works.

We address these classification issues in three ways: (i) using means
comparison tests of match quality discussed in Assumpcao (2018); (ii)
comparing the performance of the same search patterns on another textual
description for a subset of service orders; (iii) finally, comparing the
results from the textual classification algorithm to that of
procurement-related violations reported by CGU auditors. We discuss
these three tests in turns in the following sections.

\hypertarget{quality1}{%
\subsection{Match Quality Measures}\label{quality1}}

The first test on match quality is the means comparison test presented
in Assumpcao (2018), whose reasoning is simple. Increasing the number of
procurement-related terms in the search pattern is not necessarily good
practice as we increase the chance of misclassifying service orders as
procurement when in fact they are not; words can take on different
meanings depending on their contexts, so the more search terms we use
the more likely type I error is. Ideally, we would want to use as few
\emph{n}-grams as possible while still identifying all possible
procurement matches. In order to do this, what Assumpcao (2018) thus
suggests is pairwise means comparison tests between the samples
identified by \emph{n} v. \emph{n} - 1 keywords. This method translates
into a check on whether the sample identified by one additional keyword
is significantly better than the previous sample with one fewer term.
The program developed by Assumpcao (2018) does this for us and we report
the results in the tables below:

\textbf{Table A.2: Purchases Search Results}

\emph{- insert table 2: Purchases Search Results here -}

The search terms are sorted in descending order by the number of service
orders they identify (column 1). Column 6 displays \emph{p}-values for
means tests across samples, where each mean is the sum of observations
found by \emph{any} of the search items before, and inclusive of, any
particular row over the total number of observations.\footnote{This is
  also known as an alternative search where all search conditions are
  connected by an ``or'' statement.} The means test thus compares
whether the sample identified by any row is significantly different from
the the sample identified by all rows before. For instance, the evidence
presented in row four of table 2 is that the inclusion of search item
``ve{[}íi{]}culo'' significantly improves (at the 5\% level) the
identification of the purchases sample when compared to the sample which
only includes the previous three search words.

\textbf{Table A.3: Works Search Results}

\emph{- insert table 3: Works Search Results here -}

The works sample is a third of the size of the purchases group and two
of its search items do not significantly identify a new sample
(``saneamento'' and ``conclus{[}ãa{]}o''). Despite having positive
individual finds reported in column 1, table A.3, the means test in
column 6 suggests that these finds are not new service orders in
addition to what had already been identified by the the previous search
terms.\footnote{The search without these terms (available upon request)
  yields 2679 service orders, just three short of the total in table
  A.3. Nevertheless, we keep the two items in the search algorithm for
  additional tests discussed in section \ref{quality2}.}

Means tests are important to map out the relationship between search
items, both within and across groups, but they do not tell us anything
about the relationship between search items and their latent procurement
groups. In other words, the search terms might be picking up groups that
are internally consistent but that do not map onto the procurement types
in Law 8,666/93. We discuss these issues in sections \ref{quality2} and
\ref{quality3}.

\hypertarget{quality2}{%
\subsection{Textual Descriptions}\label{quality2}}

CGU service orders can best be described as investigations on the use of
public resources transferred from the federal government to Brazilian
municipalities. There are six transfer types and each service order
investigates only one type at a time. Since the procurement categories
set out in Law 8,666/93 apply to all public procurements at all
government levels, transfer types are irrelevant for constructing our
discretion measure. Nonetheless, one type of these transfers helps test
our classification algorithm.

Federal grants (\emph{convênios} in Portuguese) are narrow transfer
agreements signed by the federal government, its agencies, states and
municipalities for the delivery of governmental programs. They are
voluntary, time-limited transfers implementing policies at the local
level, such as vaccinations and the construction of community health
clinics. The most important feature of these grants, however, is that
each of them also has an individual textual description of its purpose,
e.g.~a tractor purchase for a rural community in a given municipality.
Thus, for a subset of service orders that are investigations of the use
of these federal grants by Brazilian municipalities, we have two
different textual descriptions of resource use: CGU's, from their audit
report, and the federal government's, available online at the
Transparency Portal.\footnote{\url{http://www.portaltransparencia.gov.br/}}

\textbf{Table A.4: Classification by Textual Descriptions}

\emph{- insert table 4 here -} (merge purchases and works into one
table)

There is a total of 3,868 service orders for which we have descriptions
both from CGU and from the federal government. In table A.4, we report
the results of the search algorithm both in the service order (row-wise)
and the transfer (column-wise) descriptions. We evaluate the performance
of the search algorithm by checking whether it assigns the same service
order to the same procurement group \emph{regardless of the description
in which it searches for the key terms}. In other words, the smaller the
number of times that the algorithm assigns any service order to a
different group when it switches to another textual description, the
better.

This is a particularly important point for the classification method
proposed here. The means test conducted in section \ref{quality1}
provides internal consistency because it compares and checks whether
more observations are matched when more search terms are included; the
tabulation across descriptions here provides external consistency
because it compares and checks if the classification algorithm is
independent of search target (description). It resembles a false
positive test because we can roughly calculate the percentage of
misclassification of service orders. In panel A, the service order
description search assigns 1,556 to the purchases group, out of which 83
were not simultaneously assigned to the same group in the grant
description search, yielding a 5.3\% false positive rate. In panel B,
the service order search marks 2,053 observations to the works group,
where 404 are not simultaneously marked when the search is performed in
the grant description (a 19.7\% false positive rate).\footnote{The
  inverse misclassification risks are also reassuring: false positive
  rates are 8.9\% and 14.0\% for purchases and works respectively when
  we first classify observations using grant descriptions and then move
  on to service order descriptions.}
