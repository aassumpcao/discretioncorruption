# Motivation

Developing countries spend **US$820bn** per year on goods and services supplied by the private sector. Governments purchase medical supplies, school material, and construction services used to implement public policies;

--

Constituents thus have an interest not only on **what** goods and services governments are purchasing but also **how** governments are acquiring such items;

--

- When will the town build better access roads? 

--

- How many insulin injections should be purchased given their expiry date and the number of people who need them?

--

- Should the government ask for three proposals for a school project or just one?

# Research Question

--

.center[
*Does the imposition of harder, stricter procurement rules for government expenditure reduce corruption and misallocation of public resources?*
]

--

## Context

Random sample of 9,593 federal transfers to 1,139 Brazilian municipalities to cover health and education expenditures for which I construct or collect data on:

--
  
- Corruption and mismanagement (**outcomes**);
  
--
  
- Procurement discretion (**treatments**);
  
--
  
- Municipal characteristics (**controls**).

# Empirical Strategy

**Regression discontinuity design (RD)** where the application of procurement rules follows a strict monetary schedule established by Law 8,666/93.
